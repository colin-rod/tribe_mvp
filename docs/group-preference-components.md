# Group Preference Management Components

This document describes the comprehensive suite of React components for managing group-based notification preferences in the Tribe MVP application. The implementation provides a modern, user-friendly interface for recipients to view and manage their group memberships and notification settings.

## Overview

The group preference management system extends the existing single-group preference system to support multiple groups with individual settings while maintaining backward compatibility. Recipients can:

- View all groups they belong to with clear names and descriptions
- Adjust notification settings for specific groups independently
- Use quick "use group defaults" options
- See visual indicators when personal settings override group defaults
- Access temporary mute functionality with time-based options
- Receive immediate feedback and confirmation for all actions

## Key Components

### Core Components

#### `GroupOverviewDashboard`
The main dashboard component that provides a comprehensive view of all group memberships.

**Features:**
- Summary statistics (active groups, custom settings, etc.)
- Expandable sections for active/inactive groups
- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Integration with mute functionality
- Real-time data fetching and updates

**Props:**
```typescript
interface GroupOverviewDashboardProps {
  token: string
  onSuccess?: () => void
}
```

#### `GroupMembershipCard`
Individual group management card with full preference controls.

**Features:**
- Visual status indicators (active, muted, inactive)
- Custom settings vs. group defaults comparison
- Progressive disclosure for settings
- Quick actions (mute, unmute, leave/rejoin)
- Settings form integration

#### `GroupPreferenceSettings`
Detailed form component for customizing group-specific preferences.

**Features:**
- Group defaults toggle
- Individual preference overrides
- Visual hierarchy showing custom vs. default settings
- Real-time validation
- Preview of effective settings

#### `TemporaryMuteModal`
Modal component for temporary mute functionality.

**Features:**
- Time-based mute options (1 hour to 3 months)
- Urgent notification preservation option
- Clear end-time preview
- User-friendly duration selection

#### `EnhancedPreferencesPageClient`
Main page client that intelligently switches between legacy and group-based views.

**Features:**
- Automatic mode detection (single vs. multiple groups)
- Fallback to legacy mode for compatibility
- Enhanced success states
- Error handling and recovery

### Utility Components

#### `NotificationFeedback`
Comprehensive notification system for immediate user feedback.

**Features:**
- Multiple notification types (success, error, warning, info)
- Auto-dismissal with configurable duration
- Position customization
- Action buttons support
- Group-specific helper methods

**Hook Usage:**
```typescript
const {
  showGroupPreferenceSuccess,
  showGroupMuteSuccess,
  showGroupUnmuteSuccess,
  showResetToDefaultsSuccess
} = useNotifications()
```

#### `InlineNotification`
Inline notification component for form-level feedback.

## User Experience Patterns

### Progressive Disclosure
- Summary view shows essential information
- Expandable sections reveal detailed controls
- Settings forms appear on demand
- Clear visual hierarchy guides users

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Group Defaults**: Blue badges and backgrounds indicate group settings
- **Custom Settings**: Green badges and borders show personal overrides
- **Status Indicators**: Clear icons and colors for active/muted/inactive states
- **Override Warnings**: Informational panels explain the difference between custom and default settings

### Immediate Feedback
- Success notifications confirm actions
- Error messages provide actionable guidance
- Loading states keep users informed
- Real-time updates reflect changes immediately

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive layouts
- Appropriate spacing and sizing
- Scroll-friendly interface

## API Integration

### Group Membership API
```
GET /api/recipients/[token]/membership
PUT /api/recipients/[token]/membership
POST /api/recipients/[token]/membership
```

### Group Preferences API
```
GET /api/recipients/[token]/group-preferences
PUT /api/recipients/[token]/group-preferences
DELETE /api/recipients/[token]/group-preferences (reset to defaults)
```

### Mute Functionality API
```
POST /api/recipients/[token]/mute
DELETE /api/recipients/[token]/mute
```
