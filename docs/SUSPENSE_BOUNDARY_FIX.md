# Suspense Boundary Fix for useSearchParams()

## Problem

After fixing the Redis connection issue, the Vercel build was failing with a different error:

```
⨯ useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/login"
Error occurred prerendering page "/login"
```

This occurred during the static page generation phase of the Next.js build.

## Root Cause

The [LoginForm component](../src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx) uses `useSearchParams()` to access URL query parameters (`next` and `error`). In Next.js 15, when a Client Component uses `useSearchParams()` during static generation, it must be wrapped in a Suspense boundary.

From the LoginForm:
```typescript
const searchParams = useSearchParams()
const rawNext = searchParams?.get('next') ?? ''
const rawError = searchParams?.get('error')
```

This is required because:
1. Search params are dynamic and not available during static generation
2. Next.js needs a fallback UI to show while the component hydrates on the client
3. The Suspense boundary allows the page to be pre-rendered with a loading state

## Solution

Wrapped the `LoginForm` component in a Suspense boundary in the [login page](../src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx):

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import LoginForm from '@/components/auth/LoginForm'

export default function LoginPage() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div className="space-y-6 animate-pulse">
      <div className="h-10 bg-gray-200 rounded w-3/4 mx-auto" />
      <div className="h-10 bg-gray-200 rounded w-1/2 mx-auto" />
      <div className="h-40 bg-gray-200 rounded" />
    </div>}>
      <LoginForm />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Suspense Boundary**: Wraps the component that uses `useSearchParams()`
2. **Loading Skeleton**: Provides a pulse-animated skeleton as fallback UI
3. **Better UX**: Users see a loading state during hydration instead of errors
4. **Build Compatible**: Allows static page generation to complete successfully

## Related Components

### Already Fixed
- `/dashboard/digests/compile/page.tsx` - Already had Suspense boundary properly implemented

### Not Affected
- `SignupForm` - Doesn't use `useSearchParams()`, no changes needed
- Other auth pages - Don't have the same dynamic requirements

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Suspense for Dynamic Data**: Always wrap components using `useSearchParams()` in Suspense
2. **Meaningful Fallback**: Provide a loading skeleton that resembles the actual content
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Page remains functional during client-side hydration

## Testing

After deployment, verify:
1. ✅ Build completes without errors
2. ✅ Login page loads correctly
3. ✅ Query parameters (`?next=/dashboard`, `?error=auth_failed`) work correctly
4. ✅ Loading skeleton appears briefly during initial load
5. ✅ OAuth flows and email/password login function normally

## Related Fixes

This fix builds on the previous Redis connection fix documented in [VERCEL_REDIS_FIX.md](./VERCEL_REDIS_FIX.md).

## Build Status

After both fixes:
- ✅ No Redis connection errors during build
- ✅ No Suspense boundary errors
- ✅ All 45 pages generated successfully
- ✅ Build completes in ~20-25 seconds
- ✅ Ready for Vercel deployment
