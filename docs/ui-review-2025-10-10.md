# Tribe UI Review – 2025-10-10

## Completed adjustments
- Realigned the top bar layout within a max-width container and switched the notification trigger to the shared `Button` component so icon buttons match the rest of the design system.
- Replaced bespoke success banners on the activity feed with the reusable `Alert` component for consistent spacing, color, and dismissal behavior.
- Unified left navigation active indicators with a persistent accent bar and aligned hover/focus states for collapsed and expanded rails.
- Expanded the right pane header padding, backdrop treatment, and subtle shadow to better echo middle-pane card styling.
- Migrated onboarding privacy and success callouts to the shared `Alert` component to standardize messaging patterns beyond the dashboard.
- Promoted left-rail navigation color tokens into the design system (with high-contrast fallbacks) and refactored the `NavItem` component to consume them.
- Applied the refreshed spacing tokens throughout right-pane modules—filters, quick actions, stats, and detail cards now share consistent padding and card treatment.
- Replaced profile and digest success banners with the shared `Alert` component to consolidate focus, messaging, and dismissal behavior across the app.

## Key findings
### Global navigation and layout
- **Document new navigation pattern tokens.** The refreshed accent bar relies on `primary-600` and a translucent hover state. Capturing those values in the design system will help keep future nav components aligned.
- **Right pane secondary modules still vary.** Quick stats and digest cards inside the pane retain older `px-4` padding, so the vertical rhythm still tightens immediately beneath the header.

### Feedback and messaging
- Prior implementations of success/scheduled banners hand-coded colors, icons, and dismiss buttons. Converting the remaining bespoke banners throughout the app to the `Alert` component will reduce drift and ensure consistent focus states.

## Recommended next steps
1. QA the navigation tokens against dark-mode experiments to ensure the CSS custom properties cascade correctly when theme switching is introduced.
2. Audit legacy right-pane modules (e.g., Digest history table, future AI assistants) for adoption of `.right-pane-section` and `.right-pane-card` utilities as new features land.
3. Expand the alert system guidelines with copywriting patterns for success vs. info states so future banners stay consistent.
