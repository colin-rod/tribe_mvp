# Legacy Shell Utilities

The scripts in this directory are kept for occasional or manual use only. They are not part of the active deployment or CI/CD workflows.

Prefer the maintained tools in [`scripts/`](..), and move any revived automation back alongside the active scripts once it is supported again.
