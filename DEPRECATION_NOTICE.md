## Migration Path

### What Replaced Groups?

**Old Model (Deprecated):**
```
User creates groups ‚Üí Assigns recipients to groups ‚Üí
Groups have default preferences ‚Üí Recipients can override
```

**New Model (Current):**
```
User adds recipients ‚Üí Recipients get relationship-based defaults ‚Üí
AI classifies update importance ‚Üí Recipients control their own preferences
```

### Key Changes:

1. **No Group Management**: Users no longer create or manage groups
2. **Relationship-Based Defaults**: Defaults determined by recipient relationship (grandparent, parent, friend, etc.)
3. **Importance Threshold**: New recipient preference for filtering updates by importance
4. **AI Classification**: Updates automatically classified by importance level
5. **Recipient Control**: Recipients have full control via preference links

---

## Data Preservation

All existing data has been preserved:
- Recipient group assignments remain in the database
- Group default preferences were migrated to individual recipient preferences
- No data loss occurred during migration
- Rollback capability maintained

---

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, the migration can be reversed:

1. Keep `recipient_groups` table
2. Keep `group_id` foreign key in `recipients`
3. Restore group management UI components
4. Restore group API routes
5. Remove `importance_threshold` functionality

---

## Timeline

- ‚úÖ **Day 0 (Oct 6, 2025)**: Migration executed, new model active
- ‚è≥ **Day 1-7**: Monitor for issues, collect feedback
- ‚è≥ **Day 8-30**: Transition period, deprecated code remains
- üóëÔ∏è **Day 31+**: Remove deprecated files and database tables
