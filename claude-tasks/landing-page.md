HEADLINE & VALUE PROPOSITION
Issues:

"Welcome to Tribe" is generic and doesn't communicate value
Missing clear benefit-focused headline

Actions:

Replace headline with benefit-driven copy:

"Finally, Social Media That Doesn't Steal Your Time"


Add compelling subheadline:

Experience family moments without the noise. Share easily, engage mindfully, stay connected to what matters most."



Actions:

Add hero visual:

Peaceful family scene (not looking at phones)
Screenshot showing the calm, uncluttered app interface
Split image: chaotic social feed vs. your clean interface


Primary CTA:

"Start Connecting Mindfully"
"Try Slow Social"
"Experience Calmer Sharing"



FEATURES SECTION REFRAME
Replace current features with time/mindfulness benefits:

"No Algorithm Anxiety" →
"See updates chronologically from people you actually care about. No AI deciding what you should see first."
"Notification Control" →
"Get updates when YOU want them, not when the app demands your attention. Check in daily, weekly, or whenever feels right."
"Quality Over Quantity" →
"Designed for meaningful moments, not endless scrolling. Share what matters, skip the noise."

MISSING ELEMENTS TO ADD
1. Benefit-focused sections:

"More Present Moments" - How it helps you be more present with family in person
"Your Schedule, Your Rules" - How asynchronous engagement works
"Meaningful Over Mindless" - Focus on quality interactions

2. Problem/Solution positioning:

Problem: "Tired of missing family time because you're managing social media?"
Solution: "Tribe lets you stay connected without staying glued to your phone"

3. Lifestyle imagery:

Families having dinner without phones
Parents playing with kids instead of scrolling
Peaceful moments without notification interruptions

CONVERSION-FOCUSED ACTIONS
1. Multiple CTA placement with mindful messaging:

Hero: "Start Slowing Down"
Mid-page: "Try Mindful Sharing"
Bottom: "Reclaim Your Family Time"

2. Value proposition reinforcement:

"Join families choosing presence over posts"
"Make social media work for your life, not against it"

3. Feature explanations with lifestyle benefits:

Show how "checking in once a day" still keeps you connected
Demonstrate how fewer notifications = more family dinner conversations

COPYWRITING IMPROVEMENTS
Replace current copy with lifestyle-focused language:

Current: "AI-powered suggestions for who should receive which updates"
New: "Smart suggestions so sharing feels effortless, not overwhelming"
Current: "Simple interface to manage your children, recipients, and sharing preferences"
New: "Set it up once, then focus on living your life instead of managing your feed"

PSYCHOLOGICAL MESSAGING
1. Time Reclamation:

"Get back the 2 hours you spend scrolling each day"
"What could you do with less screen time?"

2. FOMO Reversal:

"Fear of missing out? Try joy of staying present"
"The important moments happen offline"

3. Guilt Relief:

"Stop feeling bad about not posting enough"
"Stay connected without the social media stress"

IMMEDIATE PRIORITY ACTIONS

Rewrite headline/subheadline with the mindful family time angle
Add hero image showing peaceful family interaction (no phones visible)
Reframe all three features around time/presence benefits
Create section about "slow social" concept - what it means, why it matters
Add lifestyle-benefit focused CTA buttons

SPECIFIC COPY SUGGESTIONS
For feature cards:

"Mindful Moments → Share updates that matter without drowning in everyone else's breakfast photos"
"On Your Schedule → Check in when it works for you - morning coffee, evening wind-down, or Sunday afternoon"
"Quality Connections → Fewer notifications, better conversations. More time for what actually matters"
