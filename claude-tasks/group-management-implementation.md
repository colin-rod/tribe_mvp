# Group Management Feature Implementation Task

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive group management system that enables recipients to view the groups they are part of and adjust their notification settings for each group. This enhances the Tribe MVP smart baby update distribution platform with transparent group visibility and granular preference control.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Currently, recipients receive updates through magic links with basic preference management, but lack visibility into:
- Which groups they belong to
- How group settings affect their notifications
- Ability to manage preferences per group

### Success Metrics
- **Target**: 75% of recipients interact with group settings within 30 days
- **Goal**: 50% reduction in support tickets related to unwanted notifications
- **Objective**: 85% of recipients report appropriate update frequency per group

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Foundation (4-6 weeks)
**Core Group Visibility and Management**

#### Database Schema Enhancements
- [ ] Create `group_memberships` table with individual notification settings
- [ ] Add group preference overrides to recipient model
- [ ] Implement data integrity constraints and validation functions
- [ ] Create performance indexes for group queries

#### API Development
- [ ] Create notification settings endpoints for groups
- [ ] Implement bulk preference management operations
- [ ] Add group membership visibility APIs

#### Frontend Components
- [ ] Design group overview dashboard for preference management
- [ ] Create per-group settings components with override indicators
- [ ] Implement progressive disclosure patterns for complex settings
- [ ] Add visual hierarchy for group defaults vs. personal overrides

#### Integration Points
- [ ] Integrate with existing token-based preference system
- [ ] Update notification delivery system for group preferences

### Phase 2: Enhanced Control (3-4 weeks)
**Advanced Group Management Features**

#### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement temporary mute functionality (1 week, 1 month, 3 months)
- [ ] Create group-specific update history views
- [ ] Add group leave/rejoin capabilities with soft delete
- [ ] Implement admin notifications for membership changes


## Implementation Approach

### Recommended Agent Assignment

#### Backend Development
**Agents**: `supabase-developer`, `database-designer`, `api-developer`
**Tasks**:
- Database schema design and migration creation
- API endpoint development with proper security
- Integration with existing notification system

#### Frontend Development
**Agents**: `nextjs-developer`, `react-developer`, `ui-ux-designer`
**Tasks**:
- Group management dashboard UI components
- Preference management interface design
- Progressive disclosure patterns implementation
- Mobile-responsive design optimization

#### Security and Testing
**Agents**: `security-auditor`, `test-automator`, `backend-security-coder`
**Tasks**:
- Security audit of group access patterns
- Comprehensive test suite creation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization testing

#### Architecture Review
**Agents**: `architect-review`
**Tasks**:
- Overall system architecture validation
- Integration pattern review

### Key Technical Considerations

#### Security Requirements
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for group data isolation
- Token-based authentication for recipient self-service
- Input validation and rate limiting
- Audit logging for compliance and debugging

#### Data Integrity
- Ensure preference inheritance works correctly
- Handle group deletion scenarios gracefully
- Maintain consistency between group defaults and individual overrides
- Prevent cross-group data leakage

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

### High Priority Stories

**US-01: View My Group Memberships**
- Recipients can see all groups they belong to with clear names and descriptions
- Display shows their role/relationship within each group
- Indicates which groups are actively sending updates
- Shows group-specific default settings

**US-02: Manage Group-Level Preferences**
- Recipients can adjust settings for specific groups independently
- Quick "use group defaults" option available
- Visual indicators show when personal settings override group defaults
- Changes take effect immediately with confirmation feedback

### Medium Priority Stories

**US-03: Group Membership Control**
- Temporary mute functionality with time-based options
- Soft leave option with re-join capability
- Clear notifications to group admins for significant changes

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Database function testing for preference resolution
- [ ] API endpoint testing with various group scenarios
- [ ] Component testing for UI interactions
- [ ] Security testing for access control

### Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-end preference management workflows
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

### User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Recipient experience testing with real users
- [ ] Parent/admin workflow validation
- [ ] Mobile device compatibility testing
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verification

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1 Rollout (Foundation)
1. **Internal Testing**: 2 weeks with development team
2. **Beta Testing**: 2 weeks with select parent accounts
3. **Gradual Rollout**: 20% of users for 1 week
4. **Full Deployment**: After validation of key metrics

### Success Validation
- Monitor support ticket volume for preference-related issues
- Track recipient engagement with group management features
- Measure time-to-successful-preference-configuration

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flags for quick disable if needed
- Database migration rollback procedures
- Fallback to current simple preference system
- User communication plan for any service disruptions

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Technical Dependencies
- Existing Supabase authentication system
- Current notification delivery infrastructure
- Token-based preference management system
- Email template system

### Business Dependencies
- Product team approval of UX designs
- Legal review of new data collection practices
- Customer support team training on new features
- Documentation updates for parents and recipients

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data inconsistency**: Use database constraints and validation functions
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Comprehensive security audit before deployment

### User Experience Risks
- **Migration confusion**: Clear communication and guided onboarding

### Business Risks
- **Increased support load**: Comprehensive documentation and self-service options
- **User churn**: A/B testing and gradual rollout to validate impact
- **Competitive response**: Fast implementation to maintain market advantage

## Deliverables

### Code Deliverables
- Database migration scripts with rollback procedures
- API endpoints with comprehensive documentation
- Frontend components with Storybook documentation
- Test suites with coverage reports

### Documentation Deliverables
- Technical architecture documentation
- API documentation with examples
- User guide for recipients and parents
- Support team troubleshooting guide
