## Model Distribution

Subagents are optimized for specific Claude model tiers based on task complexity:

- **Haiku (11 agents)**: Quick, focused tasks with minimal computational overhead
- **Sonnet (46 agents)**: Standard development and specialized engineering tasks
- **Opus (21 agents)**: Complex reasoning, architecture, and critical analysis

## Usage Patterns

### Automatic Delegation
Claude Code automatically selects appropriate subagents based on task context and requirements.

### Explicit Invocation
Specify subagents by name for particular expertise:
```
"Use code-reviewer to analyze recent changes"
"Have security-auditor scan for vulnerabilities"
"Get performance-engineer to optimize this bottleneck"
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows
Subagents coordinate automatically for complex tasks with intelligent sequencing:

**Feature Development**: backend-architect → frontend-developer → test-automator → security-auditor
**Performance Optimization**: performance-engineer → database-optimizer → frontend-developer
**Production Incidents**: incident-responder → devops-troubleshooter → error-detective

## Installation and Setup

The subagents are installed in the `~/.claude/agents/` directory and are automatically available to Claude Code once placed there.

## Integration Notes

This repository integrates with:
- [Claude Code Commands](https://github.com/wshobson/commands) - 52 pre-built slash commands for sophisticated multi-agent orchestration
- Claude Code's automatic agent selection system
- Multi-agent workflow coordination patterns

## Development Workflow

When working with this repository:
1. Each subagent is defined in a dedicated .md file with frontmatter
2. Agents use lowercase, hyphen-separated naming conventions
3. Clear activation criteria are defined in agent descriptions
4. Comprehensive system prompts define expertise areas

## Code Quality Standards

**IMPORTANT**: Before completing any code changes, you MUST verify all quality checks pass:

### Required Checks (Run After Every Code Change)

1. **Linting** - Code must follow project style guidelines
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   - Fix all errors and warnings before committing
   - No ESLint errors allowed
   - Warnings should be addressed or explicitly suppressed with comments

2. **Type Checking** - TypeScript must compile without errors
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
   - No TypeScript compilation errors
   - All types must be properly defined
   - Avoid using `any` type (use proper types or `unknown`)

3. **Unit Tests** - All tests must pass
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   - All existing tests must pass
   - New features should include tests
   - Test coverage should not decrease

### Automated Verification Workflow

After making code changes, run this verification sequence:

```bash
# 1. Check linting
npm run lint

# 2. Check types
npx tsc --noEmit

# 3. Run tests
npm test

# 4. If all pass, code is ready for commit
```

### Common Issues and Fixes

**Linting Errors:**
- Unused variables: Prefix with `_` (e.g., `_unusedParam`) or remove
- Unused imports: Remove unused import statements
- Console statements: Use proper logger or add `eslint-disable-next-line`
- Forbidden `require()`: Use ES6 imports or add explicit disable comment

**Type Errors:**
- Missing types: Add proper type annotations
- `any` usage: Replace with specific types or `Record<string, unknown>`
- Missing properties: Ensure all required interface properties are provided

**Test Failures:**
- Update snapshots if intentional: `npm test -- -u`
- Fix broken functionality causing test failures
- Add tests for new features

### Pre-Commit Checklist

Before considering any work complete:
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes with no errors
- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors
- [ ] `npm test` passes with all tests green
- [ ] New features have appropriate test coverage
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and patterns
- [ ] No debugging code or console.logs left in production code
- [ ] All TODOs are tracked or completed

### Integration with Development

When implementing features:
1. Write code
2. Run quality checks immediately
3. Fix any issues before moving forward
4. Only mark work as complete when all checks pass

This ensures:
- High code quality maintained
- No broken code in repository
- Smooth collaboration with team
- Faster review process
- Production-ready code

## Database Migrations

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses Supabase for the database. All database schema changes must be handled through SQL migrations.

### Migration Guidelines

1. **Always Create Migration Files**
   - Create new migration files in `supabase/migrations/` directory
   - Use naming convention: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql`
   - Example: `20251002000001_rich_text_support.sql`

2. **Migration File Structure**
   - Include clear header comments describing the migration
   - Reference the Linear issue ID (e.g., CRO-90)
   - Add descriptive comments throughout the SQL
   - Include rollback instructions if complex

3. **Never Run Migrations Directly**
   - **DO NOT** use `supabase db push` or CLI migration tools
   - **DO NOT** attempt to apply migrations programmatically
   - **ALWAYS** provide the migration file for manual execution via Supabase SQL Editor

4. **Migration File Format**
   ```sql
   -- Migration: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql
   -- Description: Brief description of what this migration does
   -- Issue: CRO-XXX - Issue title
   --
   -- IMPORTANT: Execute this migration via Supabase SQL Editor
   -- Do NOT run via CLI or automated migration tools

   -- Your SQL statements here
   ```

5. **After Creating Migration**
   - Inform the user that a migration file has been created
   - Provide the file path
   - Instruct them to execute it via Supabase SQL Editor
   - Do not attempt to run the migration yourself

6. **Migration Best Practices**
   - Test migrations are idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)
   - Use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `IF EXISTS` clauses where appropriate
   - Add helpful SQL comments explaining complex logic
   - Document any breaking changes clearly
   - Include data migration scripts if needed

### Example Message to User

```
I've created a database migration file at:
supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql

Please execute this migration via the Supabase SQL Editor:
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of the migration file
4. Review the SQL statements
5. Execute the migration
```

## Git Workflow for Claude Code

**CRITICAL RULE**: Claude Code must **ALWAYS** create a new branch before making ANY code changes. NEVER commit directly to `main` or `development` branches. All changes must go through Pull Requests for human review.

### Mandatory Pre-Change Check

**BEFORE MAKING ANY CODE CHANGES**, Claude Code must:

1. **Check current branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **If on `main` or `development`**, immediately create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b claude/CRO-XXX-description
   # or for non-Linear work:
   git checkout -b claude/fix-description
   ```

3. **Only then** proceed with code modifications

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: Even for "quick fixes" or "small changes", a new branch must be created first.

### Branch Strategy

When making code changes, Claude Code will:
1. **ALWAYS create a new feature branch** with the `claude/` prefix (before any code edits)
2. Make all commits to that branch
3. Push the branch to remote
4. Automatically open a Pull Request
5. Wait for human review and approval before merge

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names with the `claude/` prefix:

- **Linear Issue Work**: `claude/CRO-XXX-short-description`
  - Example: `claude/CRO-293-add-memory-metadata`
- **Bug Fixes**: `claude/fix-description`
  - Example: `claude/fix-auth-redirect-loop`
- **New Features**: `claude/feature-description`
  - Example: `claude/feature-profile-settings`
- **Refactoring**: `claude/refactor-description`
  - Example: `claude/refactor-api-handlers`

### Pull Request Workflow

1. **Before Creating PR**:
   ```bash
   # Run quality checks
   npm run lint
   npx tsc --noEmit
   npm test
   ```

2. **Create Branch and Commit**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b claude/CRO-XXX-description
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Description

   - Change 1
   - Change 2

   Refs: CRO-XXX"
   ```

3. **Push and Open PR**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin claude/CRO-XXX-description
   gh pr create --title "feat: Description" \
     --body "## Summary
   - Change summary

   ## Linear Issue
   CRO-XXX: Issue title

   ## Test Plan
   - [ ] Quality checks passed
   - [ ] Manual testing completed

   🤖 Generated with Claude Code" \
     --base development
   ```

### Automation & Enforcement

This workflow is **ENFORCED** through Git hooks that block non-compliant operations:

#### Who This Applies To
- **Claude Code**: Must use `claude/` prefix for all branches
- **Codex**: Must use `codex/` prefix for all branches
- **Human developers**: Use your name or team prefix
- **All contributors**: No exceptions - everyone goes through PRs

#### Pre-Commit Hook Protection
`./.githooks/pre-commit` **blocks all commits** to protected branches:
- ❌ Blocks commits to `main` and `development`
- ✅ Only allows commits on feature branches
- 📋 Provides clear instructions for creating branches
- 🔒 Cannot be bypassed (intentionally)

#### Pre-Push Hook Protection
`./.githooks/pre-push` performs comprehensive checks:
- ❌ **Blocks pushes** from `main` and `development` branches
- 📝 **Auto-commits** any uncommitted changes before pushing
- 🔍 Verifies feature branches are rebased on `development` (or `main` for `hotfix/`)
  - ✅ Runs `npm run lint` - catches style violations
  - ✅ Runs `npx tsc --noEmit` - catches type errors
  - ❌ Push is blocked until all checks pass
  - 💡 Override available: `SKIP_PUSH_CHECKS=1 git push` (emergency only)

#### Post-Push Automation
`./.githooks/post-push` automatically creates Pull Requests:
- 🎯 Targets `development` for regular branches
- 🎯 Targets `main` for `hotfix/` and `emergency/` branches
- 📝 Uses GitHub CLI to create PR with formatted template
- 🤖 Includes Claude Code attribution

#### Installation
Install or refresh hooks anytime:
```bash
./.githooks/install.sh
```

This copies all hooks to `.git/hooks/` and sets executable permissions.

#### Branch Prefixes and Targets
- `claude/*` → PR to `development`
- `codex/*` → PR to `development`
- `hotfix/*` → PR to `main` (production fixes)
- `emergency/*` → PR to `main` (critical issues)
- All others → PR to `development`

### PR Requirements

All Pull Requests must:
- ✅ Pass linting (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ Pass type checking (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ Pass all tests (`npm test`)
- ✅ Include Linear issue reference (if applicable)
- ✅ Include descriptive summary of changes
- ✅ Include test plan or testing notes
- ✅ Follow conventional commit format

### Base Branch Selection

- Use `development` as base for most PRs
- Use `main` only for hotfixes or production-critical changes
- Default to `development` when in doubt

### After PR is Created

1. CI/CD will automatically run quality checks
2. Request review from appropriate team members
3. Address any feedback or failing checks
4. Wait for approval before merging
5. Merge via GitHub UI (squash and merge recommended)

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

This workflow prevents conflicts when multiple AI tools (Claude, Copilot, Cursor) or human developers work on the same repository:

- Each agent/developer works on separate `prefix/` branches
- All changes go through PR review
- Git history remains clean and traceable
- Conflicts are resolved before merge
- Traceability: `claude/` prefix clearly identifies AI-generated changes

### Helper Script

Use the helper script for automated PR creation:
```bash
./.claude/scripts/create-pr.sh "CRO-XXX" "Short description"
```

This script will:
1. Create appropriately named branch
2. Run quality checks
3. Commit changes
4. Push to remote
5. Open PR with proper formatting
