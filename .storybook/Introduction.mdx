```

### For Designers
1. Review the [Style Guide](/?path=/docs/design-system-style-guide--docs) for design tokens and principles
2. Explore components and their variants in the component library

## Design Principles

### 1. User-Centered
Every decision prioritizes the needs of parents sharing baby updates and family members staying connected.

### 2. Accessible by Default
All components meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, ensuring inclusivity for all users.

### 3. Mobile-First
Designed for the devices parents use most - their smartphones.

### 4. Performance-Conscious
Fast, efficient components that don't compromise the user experience.

### 5. Consistent
Predictable patterns and behaviors reduce cognitive load and build trust.
